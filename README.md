# LFMS_Stiefel
Leapfrog Multiple Shooting on the Stiefel Manifold.

This is a collection of MATLAB files associated with the paper
[The leapfrog algorithm as nonlinear Gauss-Seidel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14137)
and [my Ph.D. thesis](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:146438).

If there are any problems or bugs, feel free to [contact me](mailto:marco.sutti@unige.ch).


## I) Version History

- Ver 1, 12 November 2021: initial release.


## II) Contents

The main folder *LFMS* contains the following subfolders:

- Plots: contains the equations of state for ideal gas and artificial water.
- Postprocessing: contains utilities for plotting and visualizing data.
- Results: contains the matfiles generated by *Driver_Figure_6_Boxplot.m*.
- Utilities: contains all the core functions for leapfrog, single shooting, and multiple shooting.

The additional folder named *Shared_Utilities* contains other core functions that were also shared by other parts of the thesis.


## III) Installation and Usage

No installation is required. Simply use the *Driver_\*.m* files to run the calculations
or generate the figures appearing in the paper/Ph.D. thesis.
The results of the simulations will be saved as matfiles into the *Results* folder. 
The figures will be saved into the *Plots* folder.
